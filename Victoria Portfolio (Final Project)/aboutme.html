With over four years of experience studying the principles of design, branding, and visual communication, she continues to deepen her knowledge and refine her creative voice as she works toward mastery in the field.</p>
    <p> Throughout her academic journey, Victoria has had the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse range of clients and creative partners, both within the classroom and in real-world professional settings. These experiences have allowed her to develop a strong foundation in client relations, project management, and the creative process from concept to completion.</p>

    <p>In addition to her design work, Victoria is a multidisciplinary artist with a growing interest in the world of tattooing. She dreams of one day launching her own tattoo studio where she can merge her passion for illustration, storytelling, and human connection.</p>
    <p>Her creativity extends beyond graphic design into photography, videography, and digital editing—fields she enjoys exploring both professionally and as personal artistic outlets. With a strong eye for aesthetics and a relentless curiosity, Victoria is always seeking new ways to grow, create, and make meaningful visual impact. </p>
